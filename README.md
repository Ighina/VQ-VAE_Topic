# VQ-VAE_Topic
An implementation of the paper [Vector-Quantization-Based Topic Modeling](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3450946), providing a series of VQ-VAE models for topic modelling. The model reaches state-of-the-art performance on Ng20 and enables the extraction of dense topic vectors for downstream tasks.
